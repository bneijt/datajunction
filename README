Datajunction
------------

Small back-up system. The idea is to have various input sources (like directories) map onto different storage locations (like web servers, DHTs, and other directories).

Development plan
----------------
- Build a small CLI to do back-ups into chunks in a directory
- Build/find a metadata/data separation system that is flexible enough to keep track of everything I want.
- Add watch/trigger functionality (when disk is inserted, backup)
- Add remote storage capabilities
- Add storage access capabilities
- Create a GUI
